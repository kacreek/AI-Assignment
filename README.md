# AI-Assignment
This notebook analyzes a dataset about credit card fraud and compares two different classification models. This notebook was made entirely by using AI. The AI used to create this notebook was ChatGPT-4o. 

A major benefit of using AI to create this notebook is that I didn’t have to write the code myself. The AI wrote the code for me, which means I was able to make the notebook much faster than if I had to write the code. The AI knew the correct syntax for all the functions, so that meant I didn’t have to look up syntax if I couldn’t remember it off the top of my head. 

A danger of using AI to make the notebook without learning data science properly is that there might be a mistake in the code without you realizing it. For example, when creating the KNN model, the AI might have written code that predicted on the training set when you were supposed to predict on the testing set. If you don’t understand data science you might think that the code is fine because no errors arise when the code is run. However, you are predicting on the wrong set, which might affect your analysis. I needed to verify the AI output for correctness when I told it to list all the features in my dataset because the AI didn’t have access to the actual dataset. Also, I verified the output for correctness whenever it created a plot because I had to make sure the AI used the correct feature names.
